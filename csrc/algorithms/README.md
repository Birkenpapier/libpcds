# Algorithms

This directory contains a collection of implemented algorithms covering various domains such as graph theory, sorting, optimization, and machine learning.

## Implemented Algorithms

- **A-Star**: An efficient pathfinding algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes using heuristics.
- **Dijkstra**: An algorithm for finding the shortest paths between nodes in a graph with non-negative edge weights.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: A dynamic programming algorithm for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights, but with no negative cycles.
- **Genetic Algorithm**: A heuristic search or optimization algorithm that simulates the process of natural selection.
- **Hamming Distance**: A function that computes the number of positions with differing bits between two integers.
- **Heap Sort**: An efficient comparison-based sorting algorithm using a binary heap data structure.
- **k-Means**: A clustering algorithm that partitions n observations into k clusters, where each observation belongs to the cluster with the nearest mean.
- **k-NN (k-Nearest Neighbors)**: A simple, instance-based learning algorithm used for classification and regression.
- **Leftpad**: A utility algorithm that pads a string on the left with spaces or a specified character to reach a desired length.
- **Longest Increasing Subsequence**: An algorithm that finds the length of the longest subsequence of a sequence in which the elements are in sorted order.
- **Matrix Chain Multiplication**: A dynamic programming algorithm that determines the most efficient way to multiply a chain of matrices.
- **Naive Bayes Classifier**: A probabilistic classifier based on applying Bayes' theorem with strong independence assumptions between the features.
- **Simulated Annealing**: A probabilistic technique for approximating the global optimum of a given function.
- **Strassen Matrix Multiplication**: An algorithm for matrix multiplication that is asymptotically faster than the standard algorithm.
- **Tanimoto Coefficient**: A measure of the similarity between two sets.
